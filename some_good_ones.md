# Some poems to remember: 

Soft the Spirit of Sleep descended;  
All ye shall be offended  
And I feared I had offended  


While you lie hid in the underwood:  
"My heart foretold his falsehood  
O woman! perfect in thy womanhood  
Here and there through the underwood  
A nameless piece of Babyhood  
The fleeting days go by; fair womanhood  


Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood  
In works of art and livelihood

***

Wi' liquors nice,  
Eschew the vice  

Eschew the vice  
Of winning the bowt rice  
Yet, alas and thrice  

A su madre dice  
Yet, alas and thrice  
I, sir, twice  
(Although not nearly all):  
London  NEW YORK  Montreal
