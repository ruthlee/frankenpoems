# Some poems to remember: 

Soft the Spirit of Sleep descended;  
All ye shall be offended  
And I feared I had offended  


While you lie hid in the underwood:  
"My heart foretold his falsehood  
O woman! perfect in thy womanhood  
Here and there through the underwood  
A nameless piece of Babyhood  
The fleeting days go by; fair womanhood  


Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood  
In works of art and livelihood

Wi' liquors nice,  
Eschew the vice  

Eschew the vice  
Of winning the bowt rice  
Yet, alas and thrice  

A su madre dice  
Yet, alas and thrice  
I, sir, twice  
(Although not nearly all):  
London  NEW YORK  Montreal

Urbummeleid,(Ger. vulg.) - Arch-loafer's song.  
From whose rough vaut the ragged breaches hong  
Envy, or scorn, or hatred, tears lifelong  


Since first this subject for Heroic Song  
But pure and spotles, as at first he sprong  


By Babylonia's waters, 'mong  
In small canoe they often sailed along  
But pure and spotles, as at first he sprong  
Weakness is wretchedness!  To be strong  
But pure and spotles, as at first he sprong

Nothing refuse.  
Let us write Reviews  
But misuse  
He is a most  
To a discarded toast  


To a discarded toast

A prize for dancing, country maids  
And Nairritâ€™s(908) influence that aids  
To this dejected place I came,  
And I was stumped, an' sick, an' lame  
And unsubjected India gall'd his heart!  
But conscious that himself was part  
He ceased ... and in the morning sky  

*-Frankenbot*
