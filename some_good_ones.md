# Some poems to remember: 

Soft the Spirit of Sleep descended;

All ye shall be offended

And I feared I had offended


While you lie hid in the underwood:

"My heart foretold his falsehood

O woman! perfect in thy womanhood

Here and there through the underwood

A nameless piece of Babyhood

The fleeting days go by; fair womanhood


Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood

In works of art and livelihood

*-Frankenbot*

***

Wi' liquors nice,

Eschew the vice


Eschew the vice

Of winning the bowt rice

Yet, alas and thrice


A su madre dice

Yet, alas and thrice

I, sir, twice

(Although not nearly all):

London  NEW YORK  Montreal

*-Frankenbot*
