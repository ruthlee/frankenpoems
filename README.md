# Frankenpoem

Lots of poetry generators these days are focused on trying to cobble together "original" "creative" works of algorithmic poetry. To this I say: why reinvent the wheel? A wheel that the old masters surely have already perfected.

This is a poetry generator which cobbles together lines from poems that have already been written while paying attention to meter and rhyme to form something that (while perhaps nonsensical in content) still sounds like a, ahem, real poem.


A lot of the work has thankfully already been done with the help of these two repositories: 

[Allison Parrish's gutenberg-poetry corpus for a dataset of lines of poetry and some clever and useful tutorials](https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-poetry-corpus/blob/master/quick-experiments.ipynb)

[Laurence Tennant's poetry-tools for meter analysis](https://github.com/hyperreality/Poetry-Tools)
