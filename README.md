# Frankenpoem 

Lots of poetry generators these days are focused on trying to cobble together "original" "creative" works of algorithmic poetry. To this I say: why reinvent the wheel? A wheel that the old masters surely have already perfected.

This is a poetry generator which cobbles together lines from poems that have already been written while paying attention to meter and rhyme to form something that (while perhaps nonsensical in content) still sounds like a, ahem, real poem.

In order to spread Frankenbot's genius throughout the world, I made a package with exactly one use case: to run Frankenbot's `write_poem()` command. So you, too, can experience the grandeur of Frankenbot's poetic vision.

## Installation
Enter `pip3 install frankenpoem==7.0.0` in your command line and it should world. Or try `pip install frankenpoem==7.0.0`. Make sure you're grabbing the latest version, which is 7.0.0 (...because it took me six tries to get the actual package working and I couldn't be bothered with TestPyPi).

Warning: you may need to make sure to have the following packages installed (because I don't think I got the package dependencies quite right lol):
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html): this should already be installed if you have the anaconda distribution installed. But if you don't, you may likely have to install this before using Frankenpoem... 
- [pronouncing](https://pypi.org/project/pronouncing/): just install with `pip install pronouncing` if needed. This should install with Frankenpoem, so don't worry about it. 
- collections, re, random: you shouldn't need to install these if you have an up-to-date python interpreter because they're built-in modules, but ya know. 

If this doesn't work for you ack gah let me know and I will try to fix it... 

## Usage
In the terminal, go to your python interpreter (for me I just type `python3`). Then:

```python
import frankenpoem as f
f.write_poem()
```

Et voila! A poem should generate. There are no arguments because you have no control over Frankenbot's creative process. He is his own creative entity and should be respected as such.

The repo also contains [a notebook which documents the process of making write_poem()](https://github.com/ruthlee/frankenpoems/blob/master/frankenpoem_demo.ipynb) and [a log of some of Frankenbot's most notable works](https://github.com/ruthlee/frankenpoems/blob/master/some_good_ones.md).
